  <!-- MSBuild is a bit too aggressive when adding libraries to get PRI files from - mscorlib.ni.dll for example throws a BadImageFormatException when we try to process it.
       We don't actually need to process most of the files that it adds, so we'll only add the ones that are potentially interesting. -->
