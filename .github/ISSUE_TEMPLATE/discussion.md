<!-- This is a template for discussion issues.
Discussion issues can be about any topics or ideas related to WinUI.
For discussions or topics related to UWP or the app models, please open an issue on the Project Reunion repository: https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion

For example, you might start a Discussion issue to see if others are interested in a cool new idea you've been thinking about that isn't quite
ready to be filed as a more formal Feature Proposal.

Discussion issues can also just be used to chat about non-feature-related topics, such as how WinUI relates to other
things happening in our industry, or stories you'd like to share about how WinUI meets (or doesn't meet) your needs.
