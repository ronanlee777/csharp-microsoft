<!-- This is a template for new feature or API proposals.
For example you can use this to propose a new API on an existing type, or an idea for a new UI control.
It's fine if you don't have all the details: you can start with the Summary and Rationale.

This link describes the WinUI feature/API proposal process:
https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/blob/master/docs/feature_proposal_process.md
-->

<!-- Add a title for your feature or API proposal. Please be short and descriptive -->
# Proposal: [your title here] 

## Summary
<!-- Please include a couple sentences summarizing your feature or API proposal -->

## Rationale
