Windows UI Library
===========

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) provides backward-compatible implementations of the default Microsoft UWP XAML UI platform for Windows 10. 

It can be easily used with any standard Windows 10 UWP XAML app, or a Xamarin.Forms app running on Windows 10 using [native view embedding](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/native-views).

A prerelease preview of the WinUI Library is available via [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/what-is-nuget) packages, and we are working toward making it open source.

The WinUI Library provides a few key benefits when building apps for Windows 10:

1. Helps you stay up to date with the latest versions of key controls and features of [XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-overview) and the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent)
2. Lets you start building and shipping apps with new UWP XAML features immediately 
    * It's backward-compatible with a wider range of Windows 10 versions, so you don't have to wait for your users to update their OS before they can run your app with the latest features
3. Makes it simpler to build version adaptive apps
    * You don't need version checks or conditional XAML markup to use WinUI controls or features: they automatically adapt to the user's OS version

## Getting started
Please read the [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) page for more detailed information about using the WinUI Library.

## Documentation
Documentation for the library is available here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui 

## Sample App
A sample app that provides an overview of the XAML UI framework, including the WinUI Library, is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlUIBasics/cs/AppUIBasics).

The app is also available for download from the Microsoft Store: [Xaml Controls Gallery](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT).

## Nuget Packages
NuGet is the standard package manager built into Visual Studio.

This repo provides information and issue tracking for the following NuGet packages:

 NuGet Package Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml) | Controls and features for building apps for Windows 10 |
| [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct) | Low-level APIs that can enable better performance when creating middleware components. Not intended or required for general application use |

## Supported OS versions

Note some features may have a reduced or slightly different user experience on older versions, particularly on builds before 15063. This should not impact overall usability.
